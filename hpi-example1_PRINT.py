# Practicing using Variables

# Variables must in in lowercase and only underscores symbols '_' are permitted
# Varibles can be changed in the same script. Priority is top to bottom

val1 = 1
val1 = val1 + 2
print (val1)

# Injecting multiple varibles into a print line
first_name = "Yo"
last_name = "Mama"
print (f"{first_name} {last_name}")

# Counting the numnber of characters in a string
string1 = "This has 22 characters"
count_string1 = len(string1)
print (count_string1)

# Boolean is case senstive i.e. True/False

anti = False

# Variables can be imported into a python script
"""from <date-location> import <variable-name>"""

# Listening variables
"""<variable-name> = ["string0", "string1", "string2"]

# Appending to string
"""<variable-name>.append(<string>)
# Popping into a string
"""<variable-name>.pop(#)"""
# Slicing a listening variable
"""<variable-name> = ["var0", "var1", "var2"]
print(<variable-name>[0:1] outputs the 'a' character from first string"""
# Splitting and Joining strings
